# lecture-issues
Please use this repository to help me improve my existing lecture videos. If you can, indicate what you found difficult or problematic, and be as specific as possible:

- provide a directl link ot the specific video you're commenting on
- please provide a time code for the problematic section
- if you have a positive idea for how to fix the problem, it's much more likely that I'll be able to do so!

Thanks
